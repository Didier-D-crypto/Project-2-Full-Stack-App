# Trip Tips

A Full-Stack Web Application

Created as Project 2 during UPenn Coding Bootcamp. The challenge was to create a full-stack web application that utilizes the MVC paradigm and our own server-side API, AJAX calls to get, pull and push data, Node.js for back-end, Express.js for routing, MySQL for saving data, and HTML, CSS and Bulma for a polished user interface.
